This is my first commit on GitHub.
It was fun to code this card game, which has elements of an quartet cardgame and is LotR-themed.
It includes: 
- 3 different carddecks to choose from (Dwarves, Orcs, Elves)
- cards have 3 different attributes to compete with (atk = Attack,def = Defense,mp = MagicPower)
- default setting: Whoever scores 3 points = wins
- CPU Player to compete with

Code in Kotlin,
including:
- Loops
- Functions
- Branching
- Try & catch
- Classes
- Inheritance
- Constructors
- Parameters
// TODO markings included to highlight places, where important functions are being used
